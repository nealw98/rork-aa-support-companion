**Effective Date: July 29, 2025**  
**Last Updated: July 29, 2025**

Welcome to Sober Dailies ("the App"), a mobile and web application designed to support individuals in recovery by offering daily tools such as reflections, gratitude lists, nightly reviews, and chat-based sponsor-style guidance.

By using the App, you ("User") agree to the following Terms of Use. If you do not agree, do not access or use the App.

## 1. Purpose of the App

Sober Dailies is intended to support personal recovery through structured tools inspired by 12-step recovery principles. The App includes an AI-powered sponsor-style chat, spiritual reflections, emotional review tools, and other features that encourage regular recovery habits.

**The App is not a substitute for therapy, medical treatment, crisis intervention, or professional advice.**

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years old to use Sober Dailies. By using the App, you affirm that you are of legal age and capable of entering into this agreement.

## 3. AI Sponsor Chat Disclaimer

The AI sponsor chat personas (e.g., "Salty Sam," "Steady Eddie," "Gentle Grace") offer supportive responses based on recovery principles and user input. However:

- The AI is not human and not a real sponsor.
- The AI cannot provide medical, psychiatric, legal, or clinical advice.
- Do not rely on the AI during a crisis. If you are in danger, call emergency services or a crisis hotline.
- Use of the AI chat is at your own risk. The developers of Sober Dailies are not responsible for actions taken based on chat responses.

## 4. Privacy

Your data is stored locally on your device unless otherwise specified. We do not sell or share personal information. Please see our Privacy Policy for full details.

## 5. Content and User Input

You are responsible for any content you submit within the app, including journal entries, reflections, and chat inputs. Do not enter harmful, illegal, or abusive content.

We reserve the right to remove or restrict access to features if there is evidence of misuse.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

- The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.
- We are not liable for any damages arising from your use of the App or reliance on its content, including the AI chat.
- Use of the App does not create any therapist-client, doctor-patient, or sponsor-sponsee relationship.

## 7. Modifications

We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms. The current version will always be available in-app and at soberdailies.com.

## 8. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Utah, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
